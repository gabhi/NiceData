NiceData
=========

A small project for quickly creating financial graphics and analyses based on historical data. It pulls timeseries data from Yahoo! Finance, and builds charts using matplotlib. 

This project is currently in development, and is not ready to be hosted. It aims to be much more than a chart creator.

TODO
=========
- Implement frontend interface for moving average, maybe bollinger bands.
- Pull XBRL data for companies and automate spreadsheet creation.
