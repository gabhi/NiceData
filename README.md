NiceData
=========

A small project for quickly creating financial graphics and analyses based on historical data. It pulls timeseries data from Yahoo! Finance, and builds charts using matplotlib. 

I decided to include an exact ticker data feature using jqGrid and the Quandl API. I'll provide the option to export to CSV shortly.

This project is currently in development, and is not ready to be hosted.

TODO
=========
- Implement frontend interface for moving average, maybe bollinger bands.
- Pull XBRL data for companies and automate spreadsheet creation.

What it looks like
